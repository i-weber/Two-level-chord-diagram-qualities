AIM: I am creating a two-level chord diagram with my personal qualities on an inner ring, connecting to source experiences and use cases on an outer ring. 

INSPIRATION: I got this idea from a Tableau template by Luke Stanke, this one: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/stanke/viz/SankeyChordDiagram/SankeyChordDiagram 

BACKGROUND: To have a faster overview of what I can write in cover letters for job applications, I had already made a two-level Sankey viz of my qualities and their sources and applications, this one: https://public.tableau.com/views/Myqualities/Sankey?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link However, I quickly realized that this is a very long viz that won't display properly on many devices, so I figured I want to create an interactive, circular version of it. I wasn't entirely happy about the degree of control I had over the elements in Tableau, so I decided to create it in R instead.
